# Project 3 Assignment

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to obtain greater understanding of whether a country/nation's GDP, Population or Population Density could be predictor of Olympic success. To acheive this we sought to graph the following information:
  *  Highest and lowest medal count by GDP
  *  Highest and lowest medal count by Population
  *  Highest and lowest medal count by Population Density
  *  Total Medal Counts by Country

### Datasets Analyzed
   #### In this analysis we reviewed four different datasets. 
   
   * The first dataset we have referred to as the Olympic Dataset. This dataset consists of about 270,000 rows each representing Olympic information for each event going back to 1896. The information included in the dataset includes the Olympians name, country represented, event and the medal achieved. This was the main dataset we used in our analysis. We chose this dataset because it provided a lot of records and countries to aggregate.

   * The other three datasets we used we gathered from the World Bank Group to find data on countries and nations GDP, Population and Population Density. The good thing about these datasets was the uniformity of the structure of the data going back into the 1960's.

# Using and interacting with the project


# Ethical considerations made in the project
Even though the Olympic data public, we strove to avoid using names in the analysis.
